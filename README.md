## Feature Tasks  
#### Doubly Linked List
Create a `DoublyLinkedLinked` constructor using ES6 class syntax
* Add an `append` method that appends a DoublyLinkedList node to the list
* Add a `remove` method that removes a Node from a doubly linked list by reference
* Add a method of your choice to the constructor (use array methods for inspiration)

## Tests
Unit test each method of your constructor. 

## Documentation
In your README.md describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's arity (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to write any additional information in your README.md.
