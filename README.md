======

## Documentation
* lab-brandon/model has a doubly linked list constructor that sets the inputs of Value and Next for each node.  The constructor also is connected with the previous node.  It also contains a function to append a node at the end of the list or remove a node if its 'next' input has a value of null.  
* lab-brandon/linked-list.test.js contains a test function to test to check the functionality of the doubly linked list constructor.

## Reason of creation
* This lab was created for Code Fellows as part of our homework.
